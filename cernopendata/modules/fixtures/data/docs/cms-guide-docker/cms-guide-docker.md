## Introduction

As an alternative to using a virtual machine, you can run CMS analysis code in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. If you have not already installed Docker instructions for installation are [provided by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

## Fetch and create a CMSSW image and start a container

### Instructions for 2011/2012 data

Once Docker is installed, you can fetch a CMSSW image, and create and start a container using the `docker run` command:

```sh
docker run --name opendata -it cmsopendata/cmssw_5_3_32 /bin/bash
```

Here we fetch the `CMSSW_5_3_32` docker image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/cmsopendata) and name the container `opendata`.

As described [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/clelange/cmssw-docker/), this will install a stand-alone CMSSW image (a few gigabytes). Therefore this may take a few minutes. However, the image will only have to be downloaded once. The following will appear in your terminal once you type the `docker run` command:

```console
Unable to find image 'cmsopendata/cmssw_5_3_32' locally
latest: Pulling from cmsopendata/cmssw_5_3_32
e8114d4b0d10: Pull complete
a3eda0944a81: Pull complete
a88502447863: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:6b9a12992ba088a168b87df98a841d3c56dede326684f5551368fd359acfb43c
Status: Downloaded newer image for cmsopendata/cmssw_5_3_32:latest
Setting up CMSSW_5_3_32
CMSSW should now be available.
```

Once done, you should see the commmand prompt for the CMSSW instance within Docker:

```console
cmsusr@eb9ecf54fd2a ~/CMSSW_5_3_32/src $
```

### Instructions for 2010 data

Once Docker is installed, you can fetch a CMSSW image and create and start a container using the `docker run` command:

```sh
docker run --name opendata-2010 -it cmsopendata/cmssw_4_2_8 /bin/bash
```

Here we fetch the `CMSSW_4_2_8` docker image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/cmsopendata) and name the container `opendata-2010`. For low-luminosity data taken with the Castor calorimeter, the docker image CMSSW_4_2_8_lowpupatch1 should be used.

As described [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/clelange/cmssw-docker/), this will install a stand-alone CMSSW image that is a few GBs. Therefore this may take a few minutes. However, the image will only have to be downloaded once. The following will appear in your terminal once you type the `docker run` command:

```console
Unable to find image 'cmsopendata/cmssw_4_2_8' locally
latest: Pulling from cmsopendata/cmssw_4_2_8
acb4e939ccb9: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for cmsopendata/cmssw_4_2_8:latest
Setting up CMSSW_4_2_8
CMSSW should now be available.
```

Once done, you should see the commmand prompt for the CMSSW instance within Docker:

```console
cmsusr@b3dad0c0068a ~/CMSSW_4_2_8/src $
```

## Further instructions

### Install and run CMS analysis code

Now we can try an example analysis like [DimuonSpectrum2011](https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/DimuonSpectrum2011), which analyses 2011 and 2012 data.

In the command prompt in `~/CMSSW_5_3_32/src` run the following commands:

```sh
mkdir WorkDir
cd WorkDir
git clone git://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/DimuonSpectrum2011.git
```

Move to the `DimuonSpectrum2011` directory and build with the `scram` command:

```sh
cd DimuonSpectrum2011
scram b
```

Once the code is built, you can run the example analysis:

```sh
cmsRun demoanalyzer_cfg.py
```

which will produce a file `DoubleMu.root`.

### Copying files

In order to copy files out of a running container, open another terminal and run (for example) the following command:

```sh
docker cp opendata:/home/cmsusr/CMSSW_5_3_32/src/WorkDir/DimuonSpectrum2011/DoubleMu.root .
```

Likewise, in order to copy a file into a running container:


```sh
docker cp <my file> opendata:/home/cmsusr/CMSSW_5_3_32/src/
```

### X11 forwarding with docker on linux

If you want to use ROOT or some other program from within the container that needs X11-forwarding for the graphics to pop up, on linux, you can start the container with

```sh
docker run -it --net=host --env="DISPLAY" --volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw" cmsopendata/cmssw_5_3_32 /bin/bash
```

Once in the container, you can type

```sh
cmsenv
root
```

If it has worked, youâ€™ll see the ROOT splash screen.


### Exiting and restarting a container

When you want to exit the container simply type `exit`.

If you want to restart the container (e.g. the one named `opendata`) and return to your work then use the command `docker start -i opendata`.

If the container was created and started using the `--rm` option (e.g. `docker run --rm`) then the container will be removed when you exit. You can create a new container from the image using `docker run`.


### Running CMS open data containers on WSL2

The CMS open data containers, or any CentOS6-based containers, may fail if docker is run on WSL2. This problem is fixed by adding a new file `.wslconfig` with the following contents

```sh
[wsl2]
kernelCommandLine = vsyscall=emulate
```

in \Users\[username] (without extension), then shutting down with `wsl --shutdown` in the Windows command prompt and restarting again.

Test that the settings are properly passed by doing, in the WSL2 linux installation:

```sh
docker run -ti ubuntu cat /proc/cmdline
```

The ouput should contain `vsyscall=emulate`, e.g.:

```sh
initrd=\initrd.img panic=-1 pty.legacy_count=0 nr_cpus=4 vsyscall=emulate
```

### Accessing cvmfs from a container

In order to access the snapshots of CMS database conditions when running CMSSW jobs, one would usually need access to the universal namespace `/cvmfs` (CernVM-File System).  In Linux and macOS it is possible to "see" the cvmfs space by installing the cvmfs client following [the offcial instructions](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io).  In essence, there are two basic ways to achieve this:

The preferred option (working for 2010 and 2011 containers) is to [install](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-quickstart.html) the cvmfs client locally, on the host machine, and [mount](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-configure.html#bind-mount-from-the-host) it on the container:

```sh
docker run --name opendata -it -v "/cvmfs:/cvmfs:shared" cmsopendata/cmssw_5_3_32 /bin/bash
```

The other option is to [install](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-quickstart.html) the cvmfs client directly in the container after it is created (only working for the 2011 container).  For this, the container needs to get started in [privileged](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-configure.html#mount-inside-a-container) mode like

```sh
docker run --privileged --name opendata -it cmsopendata/cmssw_5_3_32 /bin/bash
```
